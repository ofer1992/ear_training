SUGGESTION FOR THE TEACHER
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The instructor who intends to use this manual should realize that the indicated
 procedure must be adjusted to the student's qualifications.
 If the rate of progress is too rapid, the student's musical confidence
 might suffer.
 On the other hand, a procedure which utilizes superfluous methods and devices
 might also hamper the student's development.
 Appropriate basic teaching procedures should be planned in the beginning
 of the course.
 This should be done by thoroughly testing the student's natural talent
 and technical skill, thereby determining the components of his inherent
 musical ability.
 As a consequence of such a testing procedure, a suitable instructional
 approache might be found.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The testing should cover:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Knowledge of notation
\emph on
 - key signatures and the ability to recognize modulations, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ability to 
\emph on
read and comprehend note symbols as a whole
\emph default
, i.e.
 determining the modes of broken triads and chords, and recognizing familiar
 melodies from visual notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ability to 
\emph on
play by ear
\emph default
 - reproducing a familiar melody in unison as well as harmonized; defferentiatio
n of 
\emph on
harmonic sensitivity
\emph default
.
 (This test might include the playing by the teacher of a familiar melody
 in various harmonizations, among which is the original plus a variety of
 other arrangements.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Capacity for 
\emph on
aural discrimination;
\emph default
 ability to sing or play a melodic pattern demonstrated by the teacher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ability to 
\emph on
identify
\emph default
 a played chord or phrase as 
\emph on
major or minor
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Skill in 
\emph on
rhythmic reading
\emph default
, i.e.
 reading patterns without pitch, then combining these with stepwise motion
 '(see 
\emph on
Manual of Rhythm Reading
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Melody reading ability
\emph default
, i.e reading examples which contain few rhythmic problems; then examples
 combining pitch and rhythm of progressive difficulty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The composite results of these tests should be evaluated.
 If point 1, for example, indicates lack of basic orientation, this fact
 should be considered in the final conclusions of the tests of point 7.
 Points 3 and 4 which demonstrate spontaneous musical ability should then
 be given full attention, etc.
 The material in the sections

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

List of References from Musical Literature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might be used for such testing.
 During the course, similar tests should be constructed in order to control
 the effectiveness of the procedure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual is divided into three main section:

 (
\begin_inset Note Comment

 for the teacher's instruction

 which constitue material for the outside-of-class preperations of the students
\end_layout

(

\end_inset

) which consists of appropriate reading material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference examples are arranged in groups corresponding to various stages
 of development and should be used as sight-reading material throughout
 the course.
 They should also serve as metrial for outside-of-class assignment and individua
l practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the text, the following should be noted.
 During the period in which the above tests are made, the initial procedure
 should stress theoretical orientation (Chapter I).
 This is followed by the primary training in melody reading.
 Melody reading is divided into four basic categories: 
\emph on
Stepwise Motion 
\emph default
(Ch.
 II); 
\emph on
Broken Triads
\emph default
 (Ch.
 III and V, section 
\emph on
a-f
\emph default
); 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Zig-Zag
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 
\emph on
Stepwise Motion, 
\emph default
i.e seconds and thirds cobined (Ch.
 IV); and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Zig-Zag
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\emph on
Broken Triads providing the intervals of thirds, fourths, fifths and sixths
\emph default
 (Ch.
 V, section 
\emph on
h-m
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The succeeding chapters (VI-XIII) contain the treatment of various intervals
 in consecutive order.
 The headings of these chapters, however , do not imply that the intervallic
 leaps in question should be studied as isolated units (refer to the Preface).
 Rather, it has eben the author's intention to demonstrate the variability
 of the interval conditioned by its tonal context, i.e.
 its capacity of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stretching
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shrinking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 according to its function.
 The example of the two melodic patterns below, both of which contain a
 descending fourth (A-E), serves as an illustration of this point:

\begin_layout Standard
If sung or played on the violin (instead of the piano), the interval of
 the 4th in example 1 will obviously be larger than the distance between
 the same two notes in such a context as in example 2.
 In the latter, the 
\emph on
E 
\emph default
functions as a leading tone to the dominant and will consequently be higher.
 At the same time, the second example demonstrates how musically misleading
 it is to think 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a 4th downward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from an 
\emph on
A 
\emph default
in order to find the tone 
\emph on
E
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chapter in 
\emph on
Functional Progressions 
\emph default
(CH.
 XIV) concludes the text.
 Nevertheless, the included formulae should be practiced in coordination
 with the rest of the material (compare Ch.
 II, section 
\emph on
a 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
f
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ancillary methods indicated in the text should only be used when necessary.
 If, for example, the reading of stepwise motion (Exercise I, Groups 3 and
 4, pp.
 34-38) shows few erros, the supporting device of the tetrachord might be
 used only cursorily.
 This may begin, for example, with Chapter II, section 
\emph on
j 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
k
\emph default
.
